##RxJava Koans

####The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn RxJava. The goal is to learn the functional reactive programming approach and how to work with RxJava to solve common problems.

The koans are broken out into areas by file. Each koan builds up your knowledge of rx-java and builds upon itself. It will stop at the first place you need to correct.

Some koans simply need to have the correct answer substituted for an incorrect one. Some, however, require you to supply your own answer. If you see the method __ (a double underscore) listed, it is a hint to you to supply your own code in order to make it work correctly. Your task is to make each test pass.
