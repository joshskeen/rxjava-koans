    So far everything has been pretty linear. Our pipelines all took the form:
    "do this, then do this, then do this, then end". In reality we can combine pipelines. We can take two streams
    and turn them into a single stream.

    Now its worth nothing this is different from what we did when we nested Observables. In that case we always had one stream.
    Lets take a stream of integers and a stream of strings and join them.

    This action can be a little tricky because it emits an observable of observables. So we need to subscribe to the

    We encourage you to read more from the wiki: http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/groupby.html
